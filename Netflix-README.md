## About

  I found an interesting dataset on Kaggle and i decided to create a report based on the titles on Netflix between May 2010 and September 2021.

 ## Things done
  * i imported data from CVS file
  * performed data cleaning (change column types, replaced null values, rename columns, split some values by delimiter to keep the TV Show/ Movie main director)
  * DAX calculations (to find the total number of titles, TV Shows and Movies and also the percentage of TV Shows, Movies of the total number of Titles that have been uploaded on Netflix)
  * create visualizations based on Netflix color pallet
  
  ## Additional note
 For Ratings by Type chart i used a custom visual called Tornado (2.1.0 version)
